The nsuds project is a text graphical sudoku game that uses the ncurses display library. The point of the project is to provide a portable implementation with the minimum possible dependencies. 

_BASIC KEYS_:
{n}        Start a new game, abandoning the current
         one. If the current score is a high score,
         it will be entered.

{p}        Pause or unpause the game. Pausing the game
         will cause the grid contents to be hidden.

{q}        Close a dialog, if in one. Otherwise, quit nsuds. 
         A dialog will popup for you to confirm the action.

{C-c}      Quit nsuds regardless of whether you're in a
         dialog. A dialog will popup for you to confirm
         the action.

{H}        View the high score tables. A dialog will pop
         up and the game will pause itself.

{1}-{9}      Input a number in the current square. You 
         cannot overwrite a number that was part of
         the original generated puzzle.

{DEL}, {x} 
         Delete an input number from the current
         square. You cannot erase a number that was
         part of the original generated puzzle.

_MOVEMENT KEYS_
When moving around in a menu, a scrollable dialog (like this help system), or in the sudoku grid, nsuds supports vi and emacs style keymappings, as well as things like wasd.

{Mouse Click}
         Click to select a grid square. Mouse support requires
         gpm in a tty.

{LEFT}, {a}, {h}, {C-b}
         Move left one square in the sudoku grid.

{RIGHT}, {d}, {l}, {C-f}
         Move right one square in the sudoku grid.

{HOME}, I, 0, {M-a}
         Move to the first row in the sudoku grid.

{END}, A, $, {M-e}
         Move to the last row in the sudoku grid.

{HOME}, g
         Move to the top of a menu or scrollable dialog

{END}, G
         Move to the bottom of a menu or scrollable dialog

{UP}, {w}, {k}, {C-y}, {C-p}
         Move up one square in the sudoku grid, or
         scroll up one line in a menu or scrollable dialog.

{DOWN}, {s}, {j}, {C-e}, {C-n}
         Move down one square in the sudoku grid, or
         scroll down one line in a menu or scrollable dialog.

{Page UP}, {C-u}, {M-v}
         Scroll up half a page in a scrollable dialog.

{Page DOWN}, {C-d}, {C-v}
         Scroll down half a page in a scrollable dialog.

_MARKS_:
Marking squares in nsuds is similar to how you would put pencil marks on a real sudoku. When you mark a square with 1, you are saying that 1 may belong in that square, but it doesn't input the number in the square.  However, when you reveal squares marked with 1, it will highlight all the squares that you thought may contain a 1, and temporarily show a 1 in those squares. Squares that actually do contain a 1 will also be highlighted, but they will be underlined to distinguish them from marks. 

{m} + {#}
{M} + {#}    Mark the current square with {#}. That is,
         set mark {#} for the current square to true.

{c} + {#}    Clear mark {#} from the current square. 
         That is, set mark {#} for the current square to
         false.

{C} + {#}    Clear all mark {#}'s from all squares. That
         is, for all squares, set mark {#} to false.

{r} + {#}    Reveal (highlight) all squares that are
         marked with {#}. That is, highlight all squares
         for which mark {#} is set to true.

{R} + {#} [+ {#} [+ {#}]] + {Enter}
         Reveal (highlight) upto 3 marks within a
         square. Similar to {r} + {#}, but 3 numbers
         can be shown at once.
