nsuds - The Ncurses Sudoku System
*********************************
. Version: nsuds-0.4B (Beta release)
. Written by Vincent Launchbury
. See AUTHORS for a complete list of contributors
. Report bugs to: <vincent@doublecreations.com>

!!NOTE!!
This is beta software. It is being actively developed, but it is currently
unfinished and unstable, and is not meant for general use. As an example, the
help system will only function if the program is invoked as ./src/nsuds from
the source code directory. And the game itself is too easy with no difficulty
settings as of yet. 

Which means, if you're not developing, you probably don't want to run it yet.
!!NOTE!!

INTRODUCTION
============
The nsuds project is a text graphical sudoku game that uses the ncurses display
library. The point of the project is to provide a portable implementation with
the minimum possible dependencies.

COMPILING AND INSTALLING ON *NIX
================================
Packages for *NIX aren't currently provided. You could always ask your distros
development team to add nsuds to their repositories, if you don't like compiling
yourself. 

To extract the source code, fire up a terminal, cd into your download directory
and type the following commands:
   $tar xzf nsuds-0.3B.tar.gz
   $cd nsuds-0.3B

Then, to compile and install, run the following commands:
   $./configure
   $make
   (Then, as root)
   #make install

You can then run nsuds from any terminal.

(Note: If you downloaded a git snapshot, you'll have to run '$autoreconf -i'
before running ./configure. You'll need autotools to do this, specifically the
autoconf, automake and libtool packages. If you downloaded a regular release,
this doesn't apply to you.)


REMOVING NSUDS
==============
To remove nsuds, cd to the source directory and type the following as root:
#make uninstall
Which will remove any added files.

MARKS
=====
Marking squares in nsuds is similar to how you would put pencil marks on a real
sudoku. When you mark a square with 1, you are saying that 1 may belong in that
square, but it doesn't input the number in the square.  However, when you
reveal sqaures marked with 1, it will highlight all the squares that you
thought may contain a 1, and temporarily show a 1 in those squares. Squares
that actually do contain a 1 will also be highlighted, but they will be
underlined to distinguish them from marks. 


SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
