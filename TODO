NSUDS TODO
==========
- Saves on quit, resumes game afterwards
- Difficulty
   - Based on # filled-in and time
- High scores
   - Currently only per-user (not all users)
   - Can enter name if you get on the table
   - Only 1 list for all difficulties (but shows difficulty played
   for each score)
- Handle resize properly so that
   - Detects if win is too small, shows error and pauses

- Use accessors for data?
- Enum COLOR_PAIRS (and check we don't exceed the max)
- Expand help system
- On startup, print 'press ? at any time for help' or something
- sys/queue.h needs to be included locally for portability, if we 
use SAFE variants
- Handle signals

In help system:
---
- Implement a hyperlink system <Title|file> which goes to the line 
containing _TITLE_ in helpfiles/file
- Keep history of pages visited.
- Maybe add setting to enable smooth scrolling (perhaps w/ getopt too?)
- Could then be used as a general help system for other projects
