NSUDS TODO
==========
- Saving (possibly)
   - Add save module so that a game can be continued later
   - Automatically save on quit, or fatal signal
- Maintain a high score table, with an option to display them in main menu
   - Per user, with name, date, difficulty and score stored
   - Perhaps in human readable format so launch_file can be used directly
- In help system:
   - Config autotools to set up a help dir properly
   - Use a menu for help topics, each of which launches the relevant scroller.
   - Maybe add setting to enable smooth scrolling (perhaps w/ getopt too?)
   - Expand help system with useful help, such as how to actually play sudoku.
- General
   - Fix all instances of $grep -E 'TODO|FIXME' src/*.[ch]

LONG-TERM (probably never to be implemented)
- Replace solve function in src/gen.c
- Also implement Sudoku X and Jigsaw
- Port to windows (extremely low priority)

SMALL THINGS
- sys/queue.h needs to be included locally if we use SAFE variants
