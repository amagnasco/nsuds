NSUDS TODO
==========
- Saves on quit, resumes game afterwards
- Difficulty
   - Based on # filled-in and time
- High scores
   - Currently only per-user (not all users)
   - Can enter name if you get on the table
   - Only 1 list for all difficulties (but shows difficulty played
   for each score)
- Handle resize properly so that
   - Detects if win is too small, shows error and pauses

- Use accessors for data
- Enum COLOR_PAIRS
- Make new game/level clear marks
- Expand help system
- On startup, print 'press ? at any time for help' or something
- If helpfiles dir doesn't exist, it segfaults for some reason..
- When printing overflows, we need to check the initial unprinted
part of the lines for formatting characters.
- sys/queue.h needs to be included locally for portability, if we 
use SAFE variants
