NSUDS PLAN
==========
- Initial menu for freeplay/campaign
   > Quickplay
      - Desc: Play a quick game
      - Select difficulty (Easy, Med, Hard, Pro, Insane)
         - Easy   = 25 min timer, ~50 nodes
         - Med    = 22 min timer, ~40 nodes
         - Hard   = 20 min timer, ~35 nodes
         - Pro    = 15 min timer, ~30 nodes
         - Insane = 10 min timer, ~25 nodes (minimal solution puzzle)
      - Show min/node info at bottom of menu for selected item
      - At game over show g/o screen with try-again/change-diff selections
      - At win show score, based on gen.c diff + time left, then play-again/change-diff
      - Don't reset game-total after g/o, just have it as total time played
   > Campaign
      - Desc: Play through increasing difficult levels for a high score
      - Select Difficulty (Easy, Med, Hard, Pro, Insane)
         - Easy   = 25..20    mins, 50..45  nodes (5 levels)
         - Med    = 22.5..20  mins, 40..35  nodes (5 levels  +  2 extra on 20m,35n)
         - Hard   = 20..15    mins, 40..30  nodes (10 levels +  5 extra on 15m,30n)
         - Pro    = 15..10    mins, 30..~25 nodes (10 levels + 10 extra on 10m,25n)
         - Insane = 10..5     mins,     ~25 nodes (10 levels + 15 extra on  5m,25n)
      - Game over shows score + high scores, then goes back to main menu
      - Level win shows current score, goes to next level
      - Completion bonuses for beating all base-levels/extra-levels
      - Before hard is beat, pro shows greyed out
      - When pro is beat, the previously unshown insane comes up.
      - Note that no levels are hidden on quickplay
- High scores
   - Currently only per-user (not all users)
   - Can enter name if you get on the table
   - All difficulties shown on same screen (no other options)
NSUDS TODO
==========
- Mouse support
- Handle resize properly so that
   - Detects if win is too small, shows error and pauses
   - Resizes fbar properly
