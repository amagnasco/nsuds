NSUDS TODO
==========
TIMELINE
- Keep track of prior level times/scores so we can show a score breakdown
- Write a menu module similar to the scroller interface
- Use menu module to create a menu for difficulty
- Use number of squares filled in and time to make the requested difficulty
- Add save module so that a game can be continued later
- Automatically save on quit, or fatal signal
- Maintain a high score table, with an option to display them in main menu
    - Per user, with name, date, difficulty and score stored
    - Perhaps in human readable format so launch_file can be used.
- In help system:
   - Implement a hyperlink system <Title|file> which goes to the line 
   containing _TITLE_ in helpfiles/file
   - Alternatively, use a menu, in which each item launches the relevant
     scroller.
   - Maybe keep a history of pages visited, or atleast a way to get back to the
     originally opened page.
   - Maybe add setting to enable smooth scrolling (perhaps w/ getopt too?)
   - Could then be used as a general help system for other ncurses projects
   - Expand help system with useful help, such as how to actually play sudoku.

LONG-TERM (probably never to be implemented)
- Replace solve function in src/gen.c
- Also implement Sudoku X and Jigsaw
- Port to windows (extremely low priority)

SMALL THINGS
- Handle resize properly so that
   - Detects if win is too small, shows error and pauses
- Use accessors for data?
- sys/queue.h needs to be included locally for portability, if we 
use SAFE variants
- Handle signals
